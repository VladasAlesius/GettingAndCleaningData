Below is a short description of features presented in 'finaldataset' file.

The background for it is the research on human activity recognition (see [1], 'README' file).
Participants performed different physical activities, and features of their movements were measured using Samsung smartphones.
The source of the description below is 'features_info' file from the initial data (see course page).
Names of variables were updated to reflect the changes made for this task.

The basis of features in this database are the 3-axial raw signals timeaccelerationxyz and timegyroscopexyz, 
measured using an accelerometer and a gyroscope. 
These time domain signals were measured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
Then noise was removed from them using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz. 
In a similar way, the acceleration signal was split into body and gravity acceleration signals 
(timebodyaccelerationxyz and timegravityaccelerationxyz) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, 'jerk' signals were obtained from the body linear acceleration and angular velocity derived in time
(timebodyaccelerationjerkxyz and timebodygyroscopejerkxyz).
Also the Euclidean norm was used to calculate the magnitude of these three-dimensional acceleration and gyroscope signals  
(timebodyaccelerationmagnitude, timegravityaccelerationmagnitude, timebodyaccelerationjerkmagnitude, timebodygyroscopemagnitude, timebodygyroscopejerkmagnitude). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some 'body' signals producing these 'frequency' measurements:
frequencybodyaccelerationxyz, frequencybodyaccelerationjerkxyz, frequencybodygyroscopexyz, frequencybodyaccelerationjerkmagnitude, frequencybodygyroscopemagnitude, frequencybodygyroscopejerkmagnitude. 

Signals described above were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'xyz' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

- timebodyaccelerationxyz
- timegravityaccelerationxyz
- timebodyaccelerationjerkxyz
- timebodygyroscopexyz
- timebodygyroscopejerkxyz
- timebodyaccelerationmagnitude
- timegravityaccelerationmagnitude
- timebodyaccelerationjerkmagnitude
- timebodygyroscopemagnitude
- timebodygyroscopejerkmagnitude
- frequencybodyaccelerationxyz
- frequencybodyaccelerationjerkxyz
- frequencybodygyroscopexyz
- frequencybodyaccelerationmagnitude
- frequencybodyaccelerationjerkmagnitude
- frequencybodygyroscopemagnitude
- frequencybodygyroscopejerkmagnitude

Mean value (mean) and Standard deviation (std) were estimated from signals listed above.
For all these 66 variables, average values were calculated for every pair of experiment subject and performed activity.
